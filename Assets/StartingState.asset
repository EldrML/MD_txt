  storyText: 'You wake in a pile of loose, mechanical  rubble. Bits of metal trail
    down your shirt as you move.


    The thunderous roar of machinery echoes around you, filling your ears with sounds
    of scraping, whirring, and kinetics.


    1. Cover your ears. The noise is overwhelming!

    2. Tough it out--the sound isn''t that bad, anyway.'
