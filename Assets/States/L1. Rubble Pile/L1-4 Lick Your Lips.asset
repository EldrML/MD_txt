  storyText: "How  long were you lying there? Your lips burn with the sensation of
    one too many cracks; any movement is liable to split them again.\r\n\r\nDespite
    yourself, you lick your lips, more to distract from the noise than to relieve
    them.\r\n\r\n1. Try to withstand the noise.\n2. Stand up."
